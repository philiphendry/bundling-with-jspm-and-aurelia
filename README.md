## Bundling with JSPM and Aurelia

This source code is a simple playground for experimenting with JSPM 
and Aurelia bundling. There is a corresponding 
[blog post](http://blog.philiphendry.me.uk/2015/10/18/bundling-with-jspm-and-aurelia/) 
that describes the origins and purpose of this code.

I've also subsequently hijacked this repository for another blog post that
describes [Integrating JSPM and Aurelia in Visual Studio](http://blog.philiphendry.me.uk/2015/10/20/integrating-jspm-and-aurelia-in-visual-studio/) 
and therefore there is a named release for the previous blog above.
